# 12 Future Considerations

## Internal Review

### Future Scope:

* The scheduler BB can be used in several other use cases such as online teaching in education, Rural Agricultural advisory, e-Marketplace, monitoring systems, etc. These can be considered in future to identify additional functional capabilities of the Scheduler BB needed if any.
* Event triggers that are based on status of other scheduled events (e.g., an assignment to be completed before next training session) or non-completion (for example not completing vaccination by schedule time may trigger health workers to follow up).
* Notifications will have to be resent for multiple retries with a backoff time interval when a predetermined status of the triggered event is not found within a certain time limit.&#x20;

(Future considerations arrived at after  reviewers, useful to log complex suggestions that donâ€™t fit in google doc comment threads)

# 7 Data Structures



The scheduler BB stores all sessions in an internal worklist. Each session may for specific activity (consultation, therapy, payroll, training, etc.) delivered by one or more resources (personnel/facility/etc.), targeting one or more subscribers(people/BBs/machines). A Session may need multiple Alerts (such as reminders,   information, announcements, instructions, triggers, etc.) to be sent to subscribers and resources at appropriate times before, during and after a session. The notifications may also embed information to help receiving party in taking specific action. To simplify scheduling multiple sessions that happen on same day, with same resources and activity but targeting different subscribers, the scheduler enables multiple sessions to be grouped into a single Episode (for example a “consultation” episode could host several consultation sessions with different patients). Further, an “Event” can host multiple episodes that occur over a span of multiple days. The building block maintains details of all schedules and associated resources, subscribers, alerts and allocated date-times in a “worklist” in terms of sessions stacked into episodes and events.  For example, an education institution may conduct a course (Event) involving repeated training on subjects on different days(Episodes), each day having multiple training (sessions) involving different batches of students. Similarly, to carry out “settlements”( event) on a monthly basis (Episode), a payroll session and payments sessions are triggered on accounting building blocks. A clinic could plan a medical camp(event) spanning several days, with daily episodes consisting of several medical consultation and screening (sessions), for number of patients(Subscribers).

The data requirements of these heterogenous use cases are reduced into a comprehensive set of unique data elements, organized into a schema of common reusable datasets, formed by grouping of closest related data elements, avoiding unnecessary duplication.  In this model, the basic unit of scheduling is an “Session“.  All sessions have unique IDs that link to corresponding entry in a internal calendar of the Scheduler. The API structure that defines the service interface should accommodate various fields relevant across use cases that may consume the service. However, some fields many be filled mandatorily while others may be optional depending on the use case. Also, all details of a data set in the data model may not be populated at once, it may be filled in parts as and when relevant (e.g., although a consultation session may be provisioned, but consumers may be appointment later). As new use cases are discovered, one can add fields that are not in the set in the model already. It is assumed each use case will define respective  subset of data model along with mandating of appropriate data fields.  Besides the basic data set needed for scheduling, there are data sets such as configurations, etc., that help to administer and audit the scheduler BB itself (e.g, Security, performance, Transactional and Schedule Compliance audit reports, etc.) The proposed resource model showing the relationship between data objects that are used by this Building Block is illustrated in the diagram below.  Support of polymorphic data sets and data types is provided by means of a list of generic meta-attributes, to enable Polymorphism in data-sets which may occur when different collections inherit common data from base entities.

## Standards

Typical data structure requirements and format representations relevant to this building block have been TMF646\_Appointment\_API\_Specification\_R19.0.0\_fixed ([https://www.scribd.com/document/448516776/TMF646-Appointment-API-Specification-R19-0-0-Fixed](https://www.scribd.com/document/448516776/TMF646-Appointment-API-Specification-R19-0-0-Fixed)). However, the schema and data elements are optimized for minimizing footprint and external dependencies, given that this building block handles time-critical alerts.

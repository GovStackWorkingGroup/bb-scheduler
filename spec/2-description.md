The scheduling building block provides an engine for serving schedule time-based alerts to synchronize activities of an automated business process called an "Event". Each event is identified by an ID field and have specific name, date, time and duration. An event may empanel multiple resources (personnel, facilities, equipment, etc.) from different entities to perform various activities. An event may also enroll subscribers to benefit from activities of the event. The scheduler may have to alert(trigger) specific resources and subscribers   at specific times before, during and after the event with specific messages in order to carry out respective activities. The scheduler building block contains various functionalities necessary to enable planning, booking, tracking, triggering, notifying and status reporting needs of multiple events.

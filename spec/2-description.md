# 2 Description

The Scheduling Building Block provides an engine for serving schedule time-based alerts to synchronize activities of an automated business process called an "Event". Each event is identified by an ID field and has a specific name, date, time, and duration. An event may impanel multiple resources (personnel, facilities, equipment, etc.) from different entities to perform various activities. An event may also enroll subscribers to benefit from activities of the event. The scheduler may have to alert (trigger) specific resources and subscribers at specific times before, during, and after the event. With specific messages in order to carry out respective activities. The Scheduler Building Block contains various functionalities necessary to enable planning, booking, tracking, triggering, notifying, and status reporting needs of multiple events.  It hosts several micro-services that orchestrate these functionalities, exposed through RESTful APIs. This Building Block can be used for scheduling events in a wide variety of applications and use cases such as:

# 11 Key Decision Log

1. Scheduler will have capability to send alerts directly to a Rest-API of target BB or indirectly through messaging BB or through its IMBB Pub-Sub room. The choice is  an implementation time decision, but it is preferred to use direct alerting sparingly for synchronous (time-critical) alerts, other asynchronous alerts can use  Messaging BB based alerts suited for endpoints on mobile client apps, while pub-sub should be chosen only when it is okay the art has no control of who should read it in pub-sub room.
2. The Scheduler does not retain any reports it generates, it only maintains raw logs and produces reports on demand. It logs the transaction that it did to give a report to a specific requestor.
3. It is necessary for any BB/application that is alerted by message from Scheduler to return a unique token by synchronous response. It can then process the trigger and asynchronously update status back to an endpoint on the scheduler along with the token. Alternately, it can also publish an endpoint in its synchronous response. The scheduler can later poll for status updates, by giving the unique token it received.
4. The archival and retrieval of data generated or received in the scheduler building block is left to implementation time considerations of IT infrastructure planning.
5. The scheduler BB can be used also as an internal sub-block of another building block with interfaces. However, the same APIs will be retained in such interfaces, even if an internal IMBB block is not used.
6. Considering the generalized case of workshops, training sessions, medical camps, marketplace exhibitions, etc., which generally host several episodes on multiple days and plan different sessions that may be run at different places by different resources and address different subscribers, the choice of names like “Event”, "Episode" and "Sessions" have been made. In the context of a purely machine-to-machine-based workflow triggered by such alerts, one can use different names as long as they retain the relationship of corresponding terms as defined in this document.
7. Although an event, episode help to group sessions, the minimum required definition is that of a session. For example, isolated, single sessions can be scheduled with just session name and details, without an episode or event name.
8. The Scheduler UI may host a calendar view to help visualization of a worklist of specific users, however, the internal storage of all schedules is maintained only in form of a worklist. The scheduler also returns JSON formatted details of a schedule when queried through its API, but it is left to the application consuming the response to format it accordingly into a calendar format if required for presentation.
